Some commands to help keep things in sync between FluidDB and your local
filesystem.

push.py - will traverse the file-system tree, add any new tags (and delete those
that are not needed) and upload the files as tag values to the appropriate
object.

pull.py - gets the latest version of the tag values from FluidDB.

credentials.json.example - you should copy this file to your home directory,
replace the settings therein with appropriate values and rename the file by
removing the ".example" extension.
