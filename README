PocketFluidDB is a simple "show and tell" type project to demonstrate how to
write a javascript based application for interacting with FluidDB.

It uses the Sammy framework (http://code.quirkey.com/sammy/index.html), a 
modified jsFluidDB script (http://github.com/ecarnevale/jsFluidDB) and FluidDB
itself for hosting.

I'm in the middle of writing a blog post detailing what I did and why and will
reference it in this README when I've finished it.
