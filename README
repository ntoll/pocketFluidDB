PocketFluidDB is a simple "show and tell" type project to demonstrate how to
write a javascript based application for interacting with FluidDB.

It uses the Sammy framework (http://code.quirkey.com/sammy/index.html), a 
modified jsFluidDB script (http://github.com/ecarnevale/jsFluidDB) and FluidDB
itself for hosting.

I'm in the middle of writing a blog post detailing what I did and why and will
reference it in this README when I've finished it.

It's *VERY* incomplete - just a proof of concept really. Currently you can:

* Sign in/out
* View the namespaces/tags in your root namespace on FluidDB
* Search for objects using the simple QL that comes with FluidDB

To use it properly you'll need to register for a username and password here:

You can see it in action here (although this might change):

The good stuff is mainly in the following files:

* index.html - the single page used to "render" the application
* javascripts/fluiddb.js - a slightly modified version of E.Carnevale's script
for connecting with FluidDB from Javascript.
* javascripts/pocketfluiddb.js - the application itself (based upon the Sammy 
framework)
